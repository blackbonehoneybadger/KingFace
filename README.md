# KingFace

*Where creators become kings.*

This repository hosts an early prototype of the **KingFace** Web3 social network built on Solana. The current demo showcases a React frontend that lets users connect a Phantom wallet and upload media into three separate columns for video, audio and images.

## Development

The frontend was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To run the project locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Features

* Connect Phantom wallet (if installed in the browser)
* Upload videos, audio files and images which appear in separate columns

This is an early MVP and does not include backend or blockchain integration yet.

## Planned features

The longâ€‘term vision for KingFace includes:

* Minting user content as NFTs on Solana
* The **KFT** utility token powering likes and marketplace transactions
* A referral program called **Roots Family** to grow the community
