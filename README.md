# KingFace

This repository contains a simple proof-of-concept for the **KingFace** Web3 social network. It includes a React frontend that demonstrates connecting a Phantom wallet and uploading media content into three columns for videos, audio and images.

## Development

The frontend was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). To run the project locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

## Features

* Connect Phantom wallet (if installed in the browser)
* Upload videos, audio files and images which appear in separate columns

This is an early MVP and does not include backend or blockchain integration yet.
